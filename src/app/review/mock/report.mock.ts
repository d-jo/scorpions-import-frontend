It is important to us to ensure that students are able to integrate their knowledge, understanding and skills to analyze the information in a real world setting.  In regards to the comprehensive exam, we may choose to examine each question in regards to whether it focuses on this specific SLO and record whether a revision is needed for each individual question. While are sample size has increased, we remain cautious when making any decisions because our sample size is small for some of our indicators. \nDecision maker(s): Primarily the assessment and practicum coordinator, along with the graduate program chair; however, the entire faculty will be involved in this discussion and final decision at our next faculty meeting in Spring 2020.\nDecision timeline:  Preliminary decisions were made when preparing this report in January 2020; however, as indicated above, no final decisions will be made until our Spring 2020 faculty meeting. \nData used for decision: Data reported in the above table from Spring 2018 through Fall 2019.\nAction Timeline: Based on our Spring 2020 faculty meeting (and feedback from our EAB), we will make any changes beginning in Summer 2020, though we do not anticipate any major changes.
